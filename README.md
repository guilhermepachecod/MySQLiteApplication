This application aims to create a connection to a SQLite database, for study and
learning purposes, using the program's grindview, loads the data table, being able
to add a new record using textviews, and deleting by clicking on the line for deletion.
For the operation of grindviews the file "row.xml" was added in addition to the main
design file activity_main.xml being edited.
it was not necessary to add permissions to the "AndroidManifest.xml" manifest file
I am not supporting this application.
Any questions can be taken in the stack overflow community
